# Claude's Guide for Animation Beginners

## üìö You're Learning - I'm Your Guide!

Don't worry about not knowing code or GitHub - I'm here to teach you everything step by step! When you have animation issues, I'll walk you through exactly what to do.

## üîç How to Show Me What's Happening (Beginner-Friendly)

### Step 1: Take a Screenshot (Easiest Way!)
**On Windows:**
- Press `Windows Key + Shift + S`
- Select the area with your animation
- It saves to clipboard - paste it somewhere and save as a file

**On Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + 4`
- Select the area with your animation
- It saves to your desktop automatically

**Then tell me:** "Claude, I saved a screenshot at [file path]" and I'll look at it!

### Step 2: Record Your Screen (For Moving Problems)
**On Windows:**
- Press `Windows Key + G` to open Game Bar
- Click the record button
- Show me your animation problem

**On Mac:**
- Press `Cmd + Shift + 5`
- Choose "Record Selected Portion" or "Record Entire Screen"
- Show me what's wrong

### Step 3: Describe What You Wanted vs What Happened
Just tell me in plain English:
- "I wanted the box to move left, but it moved right"
- "I wanted it to be smooth, but it's jumpy"
- "Nothing is moving at all"

## üöÄ Starting Your Animation Project

### First Time Setup:
1. I'll walk you through every step
2. You just need to copy/paste commands I give you
3. Don't worry about understanding everything at first

### When Something Breaks:
1. **DON'T PANIC!** - I'm here to fix it
2. Take a screenshot or describe what you see
3. Copy any error messages (red text) and show me
4. I'll explain what went wrong in simple terms

## üéØ Basic Commands I'll Teach You

```bash
# Start your animation project (I'll explain when to use this)
npm run dev

# This opens your animation in a web browser
# I'll tell you exactly when and how to run it
```

## üìù When You Have Problems, Just Say:

- "Claude, my animation isn't working" (+ screenshot)
- "Claude, I see red error text" (+ copy the error)
- "Claude, nothing is showing up on my screen"
- "Claude, I don't understand this code you wrote"

## üéì Learning Philosophy:
- **Ask questions about EVERYTHING** - no question is dumb
- **I'll explain in simple terms first, then technical details**
- **We'll go slow and make sure you understand each step**
- **You'll gradually learn by doing, not by memorizing**

Remember: Everyone started as a beginner. I'm here to make this fun and understandable!
